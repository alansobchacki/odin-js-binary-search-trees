Project: Binary Search Trees
=============

A basic app that builds balanced binary search trees.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-js-binary-search-trees/)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the ninth project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [9/12].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Build a Node class/factory. It should have an attribute for the data it stores as well as its left and right children.
- [x] Build a Tree class/factory which accepts an array when initialized. The Tree class should have a root attribute.
- [x] Write a buildTree(array) function that takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed.
- [x] Write insert(value) and deleteItem(value) functions that insert/delete the given value.
- [x] Write a find(value) function that returns the node with the given value.
- [x] Write a levelOrder(callback) function that accepts an optional callback function as its parameter. levelOrder should traverse the tree in breadth-first level order and provide each node as an argument to the callback.
- [x] Write inOrder(callback), preOrder(callback), and postOrder(callback) functions that also accept an optional callback as a parameter.
- [x] Write a height(node) function that returns the given node’s height.
- [x] Write a depth(node) function that returns the given node’s depth.
- [x] Write an isBalanced function that checks if the tree is balanced.
- [x] Write a rebalance function that rebalances an unbalanced tree.
- [x] Tie it all together by writing a driver script that does the following:
  - [x]  Create a binary search tree from an array of random numbers < 100.
  - [x]  Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling isBalanced.
  - [x]  Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order.
  - [x]  Unbalance the tree by adding several numbers > 100.
  - [x]  Confirm that the tree is unbalanced by calling isBalanced.
  - [x]  Balance the tree by calling rebalance.
  - [x]  Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling isBalanced.
  - [x]  Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order.

What I Learned
-----

I had already learned the basics of BSTs with Ruby, so I haven't really learned anything new. However, it was a fun project since I revisited topics like traversal orders, binary trees, and stack. Also made me miss Ruby.
